# Create a VM lab

## Your first VM
My VM is currently running Umbuntu. 
While creating my VM, I experienced problems with the initial set up due to some error in the codes. I contacted Jan and he was able to help me through the difficulties and push on with the lab. 
On my VM, I allocated 4 MB of RAM and 32 GB of hard disk space.These amounts were recomended, and my computer had enough of both to spare. 
I believe if I had allocated too much RAM to my VM, I would begin seeing issues with performance since the physical machine needs RAM to process everything running.
The settings changed were enabling the 3D acceleration and alloated the maximum amount of video memory to help with the performance of the VM.
After the change, I did notice the VM's graphical performance improve with the change.


## Your second VM
My VM is running the Windows 10 Pro OS.
Compared to the first time around, I had little issue getting the VM set up. Each step went through without an error.
I allocated 4 GB of Ram and 32 GB of hard disk storage. I chose these amounts dbecaus ethey give more than the minimum requriements torun the VM, which should increase its fuctionality.
If I were to allocate too much RAM to the VM, my physical device would begin to experiance issues when attempting to run the VM. There would not be enough RAM for the background processes to operate propperly.
I enabled 3D acceleration and increased my video memory allocation to maximum because I was noticing a bit of error with the video quality when starting up the device.
I noticed a drastic change to the visuals and the starange visuals I was receiving are gone after the settings changes.
Other settings which could be important for optimizing a VM's performance could be the Graphics Controller option when setting up your display settings and even monitor count could effect the output of the machine if configured wrong.
