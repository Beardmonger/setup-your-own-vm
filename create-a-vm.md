# Create a VM lab

## Your first VM
My VM is currently running Umbuntu. 
While creating my VM, I experienced problems with the initial set up due to some error in the codes. I contacted Jan and he was able to help me through the difficulties and push on with the lab. 
On my VM, I allocated 4 MB of RAM and 32 GB of hard disk space.These amounts were recomended, and my computer had enough of both to spare. 
I believe if I had allocated too much RAM to my VM, I would begin seeing issues with performance since the physical machine needs RAM to process everything running.
The settings changed were enabling the 3D acceleration and alloated the maximum amount of video memory to help with the performance of the VM.
After the change, I did notice the VM's graphical performance improve with the change.
